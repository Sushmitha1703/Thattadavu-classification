# Thattadavu-classification
This repository contains work related to our research work "A Symphony of Movements: Deep Learning for Thattadavu Recognition in Bharatanatyam" which was presented at CSCT 2023 to be published in springer book series.

## Goal of this work
This work aims to demonstrate: 
- Classification of various Thattadavus which are the basic footsteps that involve striking of the feet in Half-knee position (Aramandi) in Bharatnatyam using a novel state of the art model Conv-LSTM.
-  Curate a novel benchmark video dataset for further research in this field

## List of contents in this repo
- **folders 1 to 8**: Contains the benchmark video dataset created for each one of the 8 Thattadavus.
- **convlstm-Bharatnatyam**: Contains the implementation of the methodology of convlstm.
